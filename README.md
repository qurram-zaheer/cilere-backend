# Server side

### Requirements:

- Node.js `v14.4.0`
- Yarn `v1.22.4`

You may install Yarn [from here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)

## Setup

> You must run this server before running the client. Keep the server running on one command prompt with `yarn start`, then run the client.

1.  Clone this repository and navigate into it
2.  Install the required packages by running `yarn`
3.  Run the application with `yarn start`, you should see the application print out `Server is listening in your command prompt`
4.  You can visit `localhost:5000` and ensure the server is running
5.  You can now navigate into the client repository [here](https://github.com/qurram-zaheer/cilere-frontend) and run `yarn` followed by `yarn start` on a separate command prompt
6.  The client side app will be running at `localhost:3000`.
